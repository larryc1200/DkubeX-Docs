Developer's Guide
###################

* Section on configuration and coding that someone would need to understand to enable their programs and applications to run within DKubeX
* This should not include the general operation of any applications, tools, or frameworks being described, other than including a link to the relevant site
* This will include an explanation of any modifications or special steps needed for DKubeX, and code snippets and examples that can be used to get a feel for it
* Referencing the relevant application/usage sections will be helpful for this section
* If a special requirement or coding example is included in an application, it should be referenced from this section as well (i.e. not repeated)
* Any explanation or code snippet needs to be tested out thoroughly, exactly as written, since a raw user will be depending upon it to learn how to use DKubeX.  There should be no implied steps or assumed knowledge for this section.
* I would not depend upon an external site for any of this, since you have no control over its accuracy, or even its existence in the future.  Anything that you believe is important should be included here so that you can guarantee that it is complete and accurate.
