Installation, setup, and configuration (depending upon what is required)
This is a detailed and exact recipe, explaining what is required and (briefly) why
There should be no interpretation required for this section
This should include any authentication requirements or login
Diagrams that show setup and installation flow
Screenshots for each step of setup and configuration is important to show that the process is working as expected
Any platform-specific requirements should be spelled out
This is 1 or 2 screens/pages - if it gets more complicated than that, it is best to split it into separate sections for different situations.  If this canâ€™t be easily explained in that amount of real estate, there is an issue with the product that needs to be addressed.
